Are you an R user who works in science? Would you like sharing more
online? How about starting a new blog, with R Markdown (Rmd)? 

In this
2-hour course with live coding, we'll go on three short adventures:

- setting up a scientific Rmd blog with the Distill framework and the
distill package

- setting up a scientific Rmd blog with the Hugo website generator and
the hugodown package

- adding Rmd posts to a Wordpress blog.

We'll prepare for the adventures by defining what we expect of an Rmd blog.
We'll end the course by reflecting on each adventure as well as
mentioning important future paths such as how to promote your blog.
You should leave the course ready to start a scientific R Markdown blog
with your tool of choice, and knowing where to find more resources and help.
