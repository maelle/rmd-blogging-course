## Read the manual :wink:

You can read the [whole hugodown docs](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) and probably should especially as hugodown evolves.

Also read the docs of the theme you choose.

You might not need to read [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), that are much longer, much more overwhelming: you mostly only need to read Hugo docs when you need to tweak or customize a theme.

## Follow developments? :eyes:

If you start using Hugo & hugodown for your website...

* [Watch development on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) of hugodown, of the theme?

* Subscribe to the [hugodown issues](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown/issues) that are interesting to you?

## Contributing guide for your website :pencil:

Personal website: take notes to not forget what you tweaked, etc.

Collaborative website: even Hugo users might not know your website structure!

* [rOpenSci blog guide](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/)

* [golemverse website contributing guide](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golemverse.org/blob/master/how-to.Rmd)

## Where to get help? :wave:

## Hugo Academic :mortar_board:

Hugo Academic has [excellent docs](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/).

You can build many different websites with Hugo Academic, check out [Alison Hill's work](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) and also [Yanina Bellini's work](https://yabellini.netlify.app/).
The theme is very versatile, and widely used in the R community.

There's a [Python CLI to import your publications](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin), featured in [the blog post "Fixing Imports to Hugo"](https://dyerlab.org/post/fixing-imports-to-hugo/)

## Other Hugo themes :school_satchel:

* Browse the [gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/). [Choose your theme wisely](https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/#choose-your-theme-wisely-and-keep-in-touch). Use Hugo docs to create new site.

* [Hire someone](/webdev/hire/)?

## Another R package: blogdown :package:

[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is an alternative to hugodown. [hugodown vs blogdown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/#compared-to-blogdown)

## Hugo and CMS  :computer:

To give a less technical interface to a Hugo website, you could use a CMS, see for instance [what Steph Locke set up in this website with Netlify CMS](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/serohub).

## Hugo template development/tweaking :nut_and_bolt:

* How _I_ started: I needed to tweak one thing in an existing theme and I googled that thing; then I had to tweak one more thing; etc. Others might have built a theme from scratch.

* [Mike Dane's tutorials](https://www.mikedane.com/static-site-generators/hugo/)

* Threads indicating resources for beginners and the lack thereof: [2018](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/comprehensive-hugo-tutorial-for-beginners/12586), [2019](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-of-comprehensive-tutorials-for-beginners-2019/19654)
