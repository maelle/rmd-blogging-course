# Sustainability

Created by:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
glue::glue_collapse(
  trimws(
  gsub("<.*>", "",
  desc::desc_get_author(file = find.package("distill"), role = "aut")
  )
  ), 
  sep = ", ")
```

Used for [RStudio AI blog](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/), in particular.

Active development.

# Limitations?

* Content stored as html (harder to migrate?)

* Limited possibilities for customization (blessing in disguise?)

* Some open issues (ORCID support, RSS feed tweaking) but active development
